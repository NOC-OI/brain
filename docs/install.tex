\subsection{Setting up a Jetson}

https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/initial_setup_jon.html

An up-to-date Jetson Nano should be able to boot the JetPack 6.2 SD card image (\href{https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/embedded/L4T/r36_Release_v4.4/jp62-r1-orin-nano-sd-card-image.zip}{https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/embedded/L4T/r36_Release_v4.4/jp62-r1-orin-nano-sd-card-image.zip}) straight away. Download the zip file and flash the image inside to an SD card (>128GB reccomended for BRAIN, 64GB realistic minimum) and insert into the Jetson. Once powered on it should boot directly into the OOBE.

You might need to first boot the JetPack 5.1.3 SD card image (\href{https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/embedded/l4t/r35_release_v5.0/jp513-orin-nano-sd-card-image.zip}{https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/embedded/l4t/r35_release_v5.0/jp513-orin-nano-sd-card-image.zip})

Once booted, make sure your system is up to date:
